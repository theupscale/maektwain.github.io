I see the love towards mathematics is growing as i am now able to deal with complex numbers and there are situations where i can 
model things on incoming data which is much required and can see the beauty of it, everyday from rational numbers to integers, they have
interesting properties to remember, like rational number is always found in the form of p/q and such that q cannot be zero and zero is
also not the negative and positive rational number its the neutral number (Unproved theory) there are other number types which soon i will be 
discovering later on , but the existence of other numbers is also important and i am into that quest 

Problem solving skills, 

Lets talk about a real scenario from the everybody life, Lets say for an instance the fact that woman how do they judge or give importance or what 
are the socring methods of going out with Male counterparts what are the variables which are needed factors which it heavily relies on like 
emotional constant (Why emotional constant)? and time factor (stands for kT) and change in time too which stands for deltaT, so are there other context available which can fix into this model, this is a very interesting thing to know so i was able to come with something like this or a model for with whom they would love to go out !

Importance factor is equal = (First Glimpse*Conversational Booster)^2+Time Factor+Intent Of Interest/Sum of all events occured between the male and female

So basically what we do here, is we need to give everything a score right that score is basically just a no from 0 to 9 you would be able to 
compute the Variance that women infront of you is really going out with you tonight !

Feature set has to be designated 
Rules has to be addded
Index has to be created !
You have got to get her

PS 

There are other things about Model you dont know much about because this is the second revision of the theorem send me a mail or create a issue on github
