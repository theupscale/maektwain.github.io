Enough of the talks, when i read your message on facebook about "ok then i ll smoke n you cn talk"
i suddenly thought that what? is she really interested in meeting me, or without a single point of realistion that i am already scarce in resources,sadly she dont talk, i know after reading this or perhaps she wont be reading this,she knows, it better?

We as human , have been gifted by nature an amazing thing called language, its everywhere, in every discipline, you see around you math,love,computer they have this particular syntx and grammer which makes sure that what we want to say is clearly conveyed or not.

It is somehow true, that i have tried not to think about you, but i cannot, i think i am in love, ok but this was not what i have percieved for, i have never imagined that you would become harsh and eventually be afraid of me or not telling me the reasonable statements, behind, fine .

I understand that everything cannot be explicitly said , it should be understood but how "telepathy" it needs to converted into words and then send just like we do on facebook, i know somehow we are restricting our actions towards each other but i am being very true to you now what is there to hide, 

You can always criticise me, you can always see me into new avatars, but what you cannot change is my character, which is to love, you i know i am nascent in this love field, but its your job to make me understand, what is wrong atleast in the foundation period

I know there is something which you are not telling me, i dont know what it, is but you need to tell me, 

Or in my perfect word below, 

Whenever we meet, there is only thing which we do is talk about ourselves and represent our thoughts,
but we forget that there are always path which has lead us here on the same course of journey, woman you may not realise this when you do something awkard or which makes me feel for a second are you the same woman whom i used to know some month ago, 

I know you dont like the way i lead things, or you have problem that i am not handsome, but if these are the parameters in this knowledge based society then honey we both are leading a wrong boat,

All i am asking to get your heart out!

I know i am a terrible writer but remember whenever i think of you , its just you and only you so lets end all of these riddles, 

P.S.

Lets not talk, lets do some action, you know what i am saying !
