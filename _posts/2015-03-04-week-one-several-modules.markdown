Once i have downloaded the R base package from CRAN , the shell will open and like any other shell you can input your commands but what commands? yeah pretty neat, because we havent learned anything
about the syntax of R but before that we need to see basics, 

###Entering Input

- This symbol is an assignment operator `<-`

So we can now enter few commands for assigning values like this 

- `msg <- "hello"`
