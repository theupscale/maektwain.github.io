Well, you know you are right, when i am down, i'd like to write about the concepts and methodologies, 
its a good way to let things out instead of creating a ball of frustration which would ultimately reveal all the true feelings from inward to outward, that's being said, 

I would like to tell, you that merely if i dont have content about what i feel for would not change the state of the brain, which is going to be same , for me, all the time,

I can see what is happening in all the time in our relationship, we both have huge ego's which we cannot 
deal with itself, that's why we have issues with parents and other people, and how we can deal with each other is not clear enough, 

Lets face, it bitch at some point we have to i have realised it, there is no such thing bigger then work and towards your action which was delayed by your actions, how because my intentions were so clear, that any woman can interpret it, it just we don't wanna see it, no issues closing your eyes wont erase, me.

You know what, our lives are so different, it can be aligned but with the due desires of individuals, which 
was not happening at all, atleast i was not looking at it,can you look at it

invested enough of the time not anymore,
