Sometimes to reach the place you want to be, you need to salvage many plans because at some point your goal, is the same you change sragtegy to reach there,fickel minded person ok ! fine if that it is it does not matter anyways, on the top of langugae you can call it whatever you want to, but the particle is never going to get changed, its all equilibrium, already the position of all matter which is making us to see and happen things,forces, according to physicst what we see around from our eyes is all societal delusion, which is once created by smart people like us, we all are blind we can see what we want to see, (seeing is somewhere similar to thinking)

Well my plans from last 5 years have changed a bit to Mega Bits, ha, but the goal was way too much similar,let me define it straight for those of you wanted to know about how and way because it look too de-meaningful, 

As we know , myself even don't know about the things which i am persuading, i did them because i seriously dont have any idea, it all started in such events, 
<ul>
	<li>1.I dont know how it started but if i would go and look back i was once given a desktop of configuration of </li> 
		<li>windows xp with internet connection which made me extra advantage over anything in my class for an instance,</li> 
		<li>i was doing the not-regular knowledge intervention which i cannot determine, becuase on the large scale<li> 
		<li>i dont have much content to know and to tell, even though i could have started MOOC that time which i couldnt think of that 
		otherwise,</li> 

		
<li>2.You know then i have got to realise that every other male counterpart of my age would do at that time,</li> 
		explore porn and do things which dont really matter or give input to my general studies although what i have realised 
		i never met a mentor there,
	<li>3.So i paved my way myself, it was done not miracly , but with lot of struggle, my family dont really want</li>
		<li>me to get involved with things of internet, at that time i was looking for some modest way of earning something 
		online, that internet was evolving but yeah i got lot of options to do things, </li>
			<li>3.1 Such as being a male gigolo which was really not an option, </li>
			<li>3.2 Such as browsing websites which in return give you some money COST Per Impression which i </li>
			was not aware at that time, so i invested 2 or 3 years in that doing that, one thing is clear that looking at the activity of mine i was to tell myself 
			now that formatiing a single computer developed my cognition to work hard and never quit and make connection
			looking at the big pictures which my dad that you cannot do math (well that was fixed mindset)
	<li>Looking at that time, all i can say that i am not pretty much involved with studies infact i dont have any interest, 
	in doing science that way students were busy memorising formulae, and rotting every science explanation, 
	it was clear i wanted to experience that, </li>
	
</ul>
	
Alas those years when i was in KV, those years were like free of everything that gave me and my mind to propel in that way, the perfect way , i personally felt that instead of getting your shit exposed when you cannot handle, you should do it when you can i mean when you are young later this, was the single premise by which we founded upscale, 

Talking about risk , you can always plot chart of risk,
