<H2>Its like an Addiction</h2>

Well, mathematics is beauty, its like that girlfriend of yours whom you have to be consistent true,
when i started the deep root research in mathematics, one thing i knew that its going to take time and 
i have to be regular with it, now if i look back the way we used to learn mathematics has huge difference we used to see that math is all about numbers and theorem but lately i have realised that its not numbers we deal with its the real world
problem we are trying to solve through it, thats why mathmatician relate it with logic,problem solving skills, 

I have decided that i will study the why and how of "Math" in which i will reveal the secrets of mathematics,
like why things happen at first place in math, so for few years its going to be mathematics, for me 

Now see i travelled through Knowing types of numbers, and dealt with arithmetic operations small one and big one too
realised numbers have given us the geometery , learned to see the clock in 4 quadrants, directions are also divided 
similarly,integers , whole numbers , natural numbers,fractions, ratios, proportions, acute angles, obtuse angles, use of signs <, > mensuration faces, vertices, edges in 3D shapes, 

If i can define all these here it would be,

First off i pondered myself into the deep ocean, where i met numbers they are eternal and immortal, thier existence is 
self evidentary that why they came into first place, god gave us natural number man invented the whole number,integers, and other so forth, 

The patterns in mathematics is everywhere in the basics, on the top too,if you see arithmetic rules which are:
Associativity: It states that no matter what orders you add or multiply two digits the result is same,

The INTERNATIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM VS INDIAN NUMBER SYSTEM 

Fair enough, International is easy i dont why but it is 

TenCrore=Hundred Million
Crore=TenMillion
TenLakh=Million
Lakh=Hundred Thousands

I have got to realise the standard set of metric conversions are
10mm=1cm 
1m=100cm
	=1000mm
1km=1000m

Hence we can say that Kilo is the biggest and Mili is the smallest

Estimation is also an important tool which helps us to round off numbers to nearest values which includes to Tens and Hundreds and Thousands,

For eg: 1,2,3,4 is near to 0 and 6,7,8,9 is near to 10 and too it comes under Estimation for tens so you can decide where
to lead now and 5 is in middle so it is tend to lead towards 0.

Roman Numerals (Romans knew the counting but in thier own way) I ,II, III, IV  and so on  
L stands in roman numerals for 50 there are certain rules if you are creating roman numerals such as 

If a number is repeated its value will also be repeated ,
Symbols cannot be repeated more than three times, and symbols V,L,D are never repeated,

Ascending and Descending Orders, which are increasing and dcreasing in order, addition on number line , 


Associativity Rule: (a+b)+c=(b+c)+a
Distributivity Of Multiplication Over Addition, 
	axb+axc
	
I have started playing with numbers so as to get friendly with them, and they will share thier secrets with me someday when the right time will come,

Learned about factors and multiples , there are certain rules for identifying the divisbility certain numbers,
woah even and odd numbers prime numbers what are they 

Even which are divisible by 2 and which are not by rest are odd 

Prime numbers are those numbers which has only 1 and itself factors like 2 is the smallest prime and even numbers:)

This is the little synopsis of my mathematical journey from the last 2 weeks, its little messed up but soon it will be organised where i will be psoting things in more categorised way !
