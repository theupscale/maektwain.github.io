Well, mathematics is beauty, its like that girlfriend of yours whom you have to be consistent true,
when i started the deep root research in mathematics, one thing i knew that its going to take time and 
i have to be regular with it, now if i look back the way we used to learn mathematics has huge difference if you we'd 
always thought that math is all about numbers but lately realised that its not numbers we deal its something else, its called
logic,problem solving skills,

I have decided that i will study the why and how of "Math" in which i will reveal the secrets of mathematics,
like why things happen at first place in math, so for few years its going to be mathematics, 

Now see i travelled through Knowing types of numbers, and dealt with arithmetic operations small one and big one too
realised numbers have given us the geometery , learned to see the clock in 4 quadrants, directions are also divided 
similarly,integers , whole numbers , natural numbers,fractions, ratios, proportions, acute angles, obtuse angles, use of signs <, > mensuration faces, vertices, edges in 3D shapes, 

If i can define all these here it would be,

First off i pondered myself into the deep ocean, where i met numbers they are eternal and immortal, thier existence is 
self evidentary that why they came into first place, god gave us natural number man invented the whole number,integers, and other so forth, 

The patterns in mathematics is everywhere in the basics, on the top too,if you see arithmetic rules which are:
Commutativity: It states that no matter what orders you add or multiply two digits the result is same,

The INTERNATIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM VS INDIAN NUMBER SYSTEM 

Fairly International is easy i dont why but it is 

TenCrore=Hundred Million
Crore=TenMillion
TenLakh=Million
Lakh=Hundred Thousands

I have got to realise the standard set of metric conversions are
10mm=1cm 
1m=100cm
	=1000mm
1km=1000m

Hence we can say that Kilo is the biggest and Mili is the smallest

Estimation is also an important tool which helps us to round off numbers to nearest values which includes to Tens and Hundreds and Thousands,

For eg: 1,2,3,4 is near to 0 and 6,7,8,9 is near to 10 and too it comes under Estimation for tens so you can decide where
to lead now and 5 is in middle so it is tend to lead towards 0.

Roman Numerals (Romans knew the counting but in thier own way) I ,II, III, IV  and so on  
L stands in roman numerals for 50 there are certain rules if you are creating roman numerals such as 

If a number is repeated its value will also be repeated
