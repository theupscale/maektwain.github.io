You know what its really annoying when you are setting up things for web based application,it requires
you to set up a server, install webserver, db server woah and meet all those dependencies, which we all developer might
end up as an nightmare, no, this time i did a little research about github pages , how they work, voila and excatly what i 
need, see my problems are while developin an app over are

1.Setting upon a server would require me to master all the linux based bull***t which i dont want to spend 2 days in.
2.No database hassles because my requirements were simple, content and design based website.
3.I don't want to spend 4 days in asking friends and people that which is good cms (open source)
4.Installing that cms is a cumbersome task, few days ago i had seen that while ankit was even struggling in that (even though he is good in that!)

So this "jekyll" came as a surprise no headache only what i need things which i am getting from jekyll are :

1.All above things which i have to do to even for an HTML website i dont have to, and i am saving myself from the overhead cost of the server too
which is a good things all the data is getting through "GITHUB" its sweet.

So No DB, nothing at all just plain file system based on ruby, all i did just installed "jekyll" and went through a simple ride of some swet github 
commands and you can see this blog easy peasy!


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
