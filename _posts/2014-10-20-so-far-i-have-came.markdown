Three months ago i met few special people those were people, who can talk about sub-concious mind, talk about "Shiva" the legendary 
god who was once called "Neelkanth", they talk about not taking formal education, and i am talking about them,hahaah,anyways,

I have been growing solid grounds and is seeing world in new shapes, err....not out of reality the box of reality is still there,
but after going through the technical terminologies which i think out in the general public,people have been using it too badly,for
an instance today i will show you how, that is happening.

3.A lot has happened around the globe Modi, went to US for sales to NRI and other companies for do come india and invest on us, thats
pretty good,diesel prices has gone down and has been deregulated, Ravish Kumar, and arnab goswami they have been doing news on racism,
communal harmony and other social,religios beliefs,

4.I have been writing an academic paper on india's struggle on freeedom (it was given to me by my teacher)

5.Mishra'ji state of rationalism, i dont know what are you talking about, sometimes i cannot speak because i feel like 
wasting my energy on the entire topic,

6.Ankit has been the long lasting association ever happened, to me despite of so many disturbances in the work and personal.

Now, little bit of mathematics, i have been quite studying mathematics and programming for a while, learned some-thing new
	1.No body is born mathematician
	2.Its just the subject which is not easy,
	3.Easy thing human forget easily 
	4.Where you face challenge and go through it you remeber it for life,
	5.Struggle fail and do more in math , dont quit
	6.Accept your failure in math and live with growth mindset people
What are growth mindset people 
	People who do not say to you that you cannot do math, or fill negative thoughts to you!
	
Above no 1 where i was talking about is called ["Equivocation"][equi] and "Weasel Word" where people tend to use meaningful words which they add thier personal sense to it and deliver it and more importantly those words are not fit to be there "jargons" are for something else lets take some example here

Mostly i have been seeing things as Fallaciously wrong or reasoning, where i have been advocating people about what they have said they should look at thier premises and try to validate it and if they are wrong they should work on it, instead of adding more jargons to it
