Talking about data science its important to stick with basic tools such as R because it is higly inspired by statistical inferences and infact data science is too,

###Overview and History of R

First question comes is What is R?
R is a dialect of S Language . Thats it 

Then What is S?

S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs , in 1976 as an internal statistical analysis enviornment  originally implemented as Fortran Libraries,primitve versions were not having functions
for statistical analysis , in 1988 system was re-rewritten in C version 4 is what we use today.

####Historical Notes about what is S?

- In 1993 Bell Labs gave StatSci now Insightful Corp an exclusive license to develop and sell the language S
- In 2004 Insightful purchased the S language from Lucent for $2 million 
- In 2006 Alcaltel purchased Lucent Technologies
- Insightful sell S as S-PLUS
- The fundamental of S Language itself has not changed since 1988

####Back to R

- 1991 : Created in New Zeland by Ross Inaka and Robert Gentleman
- 1993 : First announcement of R to the Public
- 1995 : Martin Machler convinced the authors to release R as Open Source GNU
- 1996 : A public mailing list is created 
- 1997 : R core group is formed 
- 2000 : R version 1.0.0 is released
- 2013 : R version 3.0.2 is released on December 

###Features of R

- Syntax is very similar to S, making it easy for S-PLUS users to switch over
- Semantics are superficially similar to S
- Runs on almost any standard OS/Platform
- Frequent Releases 
- Quite lean as far as software goes functionality is divided into modular packages 
- Graphics capabilities very sophisticated and better than most stat packages
- Useful for interactive work, but contains a powerful programming language for developing new tools 
- Very active and vibrant user community 

###With Free Software you are granted

- Freedom to run the program
- Freedom to modify according to your needs,
- Freedom to redistribute copies, according to Open Source rules 
- Freedom to improve the program and release the improvments to public

###Drawbacks of R

- Based on 40 year technology 
- Little built in support for dynamic or 3-D graphics 
- Functionality is based on consumer demand and user contributins , you have to implement your own fav method,
- R stores every objects in physical memory but there are achievements to deal with this 
- Not ideal for all possible situations (It a restriction for every software too)

###Design of the R System 

- The R is divided into 2 parts
- The base R that we download from CRAN 
- Everything Else

###R functionality is divided into a number of packages

- The base R system contains in the "base" system include utils, stats, datasets, graphics, grDevices, grid, methods, tools, parallel, compiler. splines, tcltk, stats4.
- There are also Recommended pakcages : boot, class, cluster, codetools, foreign, KernSmooth, lattice, mgcv, rpart, survival, MAASS, spatial, nnet, Matrix

###Design of the R system

- There are about 4000 packages on CRAN that have been developed by users and programmers
- Bioconductor packages associated 
- There is no reliable way to keep track of how many packages are available.

###Some R Resources 
####Available from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)
- An introduction to R
- Writing R extensions
- R data import/export
- R installation and administration 
- R internals
