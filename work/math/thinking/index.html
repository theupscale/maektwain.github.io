			<p>
				What is math, people tend to avoid that question even after practising this particular subject, history even though we have been through countless times of similar situation in math but we don't know where does it all started we haven't been given a chance in school's and other academia that what does this subject is all about, even though we know the interpretation of x+y=1.

			<h3>
				History
			</h3>
			
			<p class="p1">
				Over the years, I've met many people who graduated with degrees <span>in such mathematically rich subjects as engineering, physics, computer science, and even mathematics</span> <span>itself, who have told me that they went through their entire school and college-level education without ever</span> <span>gaining a good overview of what constitutes modern mathematics.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				Most of the mathematics used in present-day science and engineering is no more than three- or four-<span>hundred years old, much of it less than a century old. Yet the typical high school curriculum comprises</span> <span>mathematics at least three-hundred years old some of it over two-thousand years old!</span>
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				<strong>Mathematics is believed to have begun with the invention of numbers and arithmetic around ten <span>thousand years ago, in order to give the world money. (Yes, it seems it began with money!)</span></strong>
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				Yet most of the mathematics used in <span>today's world was developed in the last two hundred years!</span> <span>The explosion of mathematical activity that has taken place over the past hundred years or so in</span> <span>particular has been dramatic. At the start of the twentieth century, mathematics could reasonably be</span> <span>regarded as consisting of about twelve distinct subjects: arithmetic, geometry, calculus, and several more.</span> <span>Today, between sixty and seventy distinct categories would be a reasonable gure. Some subjects, like</span> <span>algebra or topology, have split into various sub fields; others, such as complexity theory or dynamical</span> <span>systems theory, are completely new areas of study.</span>
